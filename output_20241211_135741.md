Final ResultBelow is the completed Python script demonstrating asynchronous programming concepts in real-world scenarios. The script integrates data fetching, file-based I/O, and different async execution patterns with beginner-friendly comments.pythonКопировать кодimport aiohttp  # Library for handling HTTP requests asynchronously

Corrections and AssumptionsCorrections:Ensured that file paths and URLs in the script are placeholders and require user updates for actual testing.Enhanced inline comments for clarity and educational purposes.Assumptions:Users will provide valid pre-created input files and specify their paths.The URLs used in data fetching are accessible and return appropriate responses for the demonstration.Error handling is simplified for educational purposes; advanced mechanisms like retries or timeouts can be added as needed.This solution fully addresses the requirements by demonstrating sequential execution, concurrent execution, and task management using aiohttp, asyncio, and aiofiles. It includes clear comments to facilitate understanding, ensuring the script serves as an educational tool for asynchronous programming.
