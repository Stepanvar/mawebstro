Objective: Generate a web-based intelligent assistant designed to help users with coding projects and learning new topics using ai-orchestrating method
Sub-tasks to consider:
1. Implement Objective Classification:
Develop a classification mechanism that automatically determines whether the user's input objective is for project code generation or learning purposes.
Utilize keyword analysis or natural language processing techniques to accurately categorize the objective.
2. Generate Clarifying Questions (Clarification Stage):
Based on the classified objective type, GPT AI MODEL must GENERATE at least four comprehensive and appropriate clarifying questions to better understand the user's specific needs and goals.
Ensure the questions are tailored to the objective type:
For project code generation:
Ask about specific to the current objective questions, desired features, clarify potential ambiguities, etc.
For learning objectives:
Inquire about specific to the current objective questions, the current knowledge level, specific topics of interest, preferred learning style, potential hard themes, etc.
3. Enhance User Control:
Present the generated clarifying questions to the user before proceeding with the orchestration stage.
Collect the user's responses to these questions to refine the system's understanding of the objective.
4. Adapt Orchestrator and Prompts:
Utilize the clarified information to create more specific and effective prompts for the GPT orchestrator.
Ensure that the orchestrator uses the user's responses to generate tailored sub-tasks and deliver more relevant results.
Develop separate prompt templates or strategies for each objective type to enhance the quality of interactions.
5. Improve Overall User Experience:
Design the system to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users with little to no programming experience.
Provide clear instructions and feedback at each stage of the interaction.
Incorporate error handling to manage unexpected inputs or situations gracefully.

We'll approach this as a panel of experts:Dr. Alex Novak, a Natural Language Processing specialist with an ACM award for advancements in text classification methods.Dr. Elena Zhao, a software architect renowned for scalable NLP model integration in user-centric applications.Dr. Michael Grant, a machine learning expert, awarded for his contributions to real-world NLP application in learning and development systems.Before proceeding, we’d like to clarify the following:Are there any specific libraries or frameworks you prefer for NLP (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or transformer-based models like BERT)?Would you prefer the initial model to be rule-based, purely keyword-driven, or is the immediate focus on implementing an ML-based classifier?Once confirmed, we can create a step-by-step solution based on your inputs. Here's a proposed outline to start with:TL;DRWe'll build a classification system that distinguishes user objectives into "Project Code Generation" and "Learning Purpose" categories, using a combination of keyword analysis and machine learning, with a fallback for uncertain cases.Step-by-Step ImplementationInput Analysis:Objective Parsing: Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy) to parse user input, extracting keywords, phrases, and the objective's context. Implement a method to extract common patterns like verbs and objects, focusing on action-oriented language for "Project Code Generation" and knowledge-oriented language for "Learning Purpose."Keyword Analysis:Keyword Database: Create a dictionary of terms associated with project and learning objectives (e.g., “build,” “code,” “develop” for project generation; “learn,” “study,” “understand” for learning).Rule-Based Scoring: Assign scores based on keyword matches in user input, weighted by relevance. For instance, stronger terms like "implement" might score higher for project generation.Machine Learning Classification (Optional):Dataset Preparation: Collect sample objectives with labeled classifications (“Project Code Generation” and “Learning Purpose”). The dataset can be expanded over time with user inputs to improve accuracy.Model Selection: Start with a simple logistic regression or SVM, focusing on explainable results. Include features like TF-IDF vectorization to capture significant terms.Model Training and Validation: Train the model on the prepared dataset and validate accuracy. Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve classification confidence and reduce uncertainty.Fallback Mechanism:Confidence Threshold: Implement a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.7) for the classification. If the model’s confidence falls below this level, classify the objective as “Uncertain.”Request Clarification: In “Uncertain” cases, prompt users for additional information to improve the classifier's accuracy.Output and Testing:Output Format: Return the classification results as “Project Code Generation,” “Learning Purpose,” or “Uncertain.”Test Cases: Create a set of test cases that includes straightforward and ambiguous objectives. Examples include: "develop a new feature," "learn about neural networks," and edge cases like "explore coding practices."Performance Optimization: Profile code for speed to ensure it can handle high user volumes, and modularize functions for easy integration.Documentation:Classification Logic: Describe the rules, keywords, and model parameters used.Model Maintenance: Provide instructions for updating keywords and retraining the ML model with new data.By combining keyword-driven logic with optional machine learning, this mechanism will adapt to user input variations over time. Once we confirm preferred tools and libraries, we can proceed with an in-depth code structure.
We'll address this as a panel of experts:Dr. Samantha Lee, NLP and text classification specialist with experience in designing modular, real-time classification systems.Dr. David Martinez, software engineer with a focus on scalable, keyword-based search and classification for user-driven applications.Dr. Rebecca Chang, machine learning expert known for her work on adaptive learning models for classification with feedback mechanisms.Before diving into the full implementation, here are a few questions to clarify:Do you have a preferred set of test cases, or should we generate typical cases based on common objectives?Would you like the initial approach to focus on the keyword method exclusively, or should we include a simple machine learning model from the start?Once we confirm, here is a proposed step-by-step implementation:Implementation Outline1. Input AnalysisPreprocess User Input: Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation to ensure consistency.Tokenization: Split the input into tokens (words or phrases) using NLP libraries such as spaCy or NLTK.Keyword Extraction: Identify action words (verbs) and objects to understand the purpose.2. Classification Criteria and Keyword AnalysisDefine Keyword Sets:Project Code Generation: Use keywords like "build," "develop," "code," "implement," "feature," "bug fix," etc.Learning Purpose: Use keywords like "learn," "understand," "study," "tutorial," "course," "concept," etc.Rule-Based Scoring:Implement a scoring function that checks for keyword matches. Weight each keyword (e.g., "build" might carry more weight than "modify" in identifying project generation).If both categories have keyword hits, select the category with the higher total score.3. Machine Learning Classification (Optional)Dataset:Collect labeled data with examples for both objectives (e.g., "Implement feature X" as project code generation, "Learn about neural networks" as learning).Model Selection:Start with Logistic Regression or SVM for simple interpretability, using TF-IDF for feature extraction.Training and Confidence Scoring:Train the model and set a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.7) below which the objective is flagged as "Uncertain."Include a fallback to request user clarification when confidence is low.4. Fallback MechanismLow-Confidence Handling:When confidence is below threshold or keywords are too ambiguous, label as “Uncertain.”Optionally, prompt users for more information if the classifier is embedded in an interactive system.5. OutputReturn Format:Return a structured response with classification result: “Project Code Generation,” “Learning Purpose,” or “Uncertain.”6. TestingTest Cases:Create sample inputs covering straightforward cases, ambiguous objectives, and edge cases.Examples:"Develop a new login feature" → "Project Code Generation
